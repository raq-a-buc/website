              <p>My name is Kiara Arrington, I am a co-Director of RhythmX Dance Lab. I have been Clogging since I was 5 years old. I was born and raised in Idaho and learned how to clog with a studio called Rocky Top Cloggers which then in 2014 started transitioning to what is now known as Ground Control Studio located in Twin Falls, ID. Once Adison and Hailey Hillstead took over I was able to tremendously grow as a clogger and a choreographer. So much so that I won several overalls and MVP’s both individually and with my team. I was able to join the All American team in 2016 and in 2019 I won MVP Acapella Solo which is one of my greatest accomplishments to this day. I ended up moving to Utah and parting ways with that studio in 2021. I then started teaching several classes at Starz Unlimited Studio for 3 years until I was able to go off on my own and open a dance studio alongside Raquel Bucio. In 2018 I joined a traveling clogging team called Clog America. I have traveled all over Europe and Asia performing with this team for the past 7 years and will continue to do so in the future. It has always been a dream of mine to have my own studio and now my dreams are coming true! I can't wait to teach and coach you and your kids!</p>

            <p>Hello, I’m Raquel Bucio, co-director of RhythmX Dance Lab. I started clogging in the 3rd grade when my elementary school teacher started teaching clogging after school. I immediately fell in love, and that summer I relentlessly asked my mom to keep me in clogging. I danced with Extravagance for 12 years, which specialized in clogging, hip-hop, and jazz, which gave me exposure to other dance types. I then started dancing at Starz Unlimited for a few years and also became a competition team teacher. I have been given so many wonderful opportunities through clogging and dance, including making so many new friends, being a team captain, joining the All-American champions team multiple times, teaching clogging for the last 6 years, and traveling Europe as a representative of the United States of America with Clog America and AFE. I am overjoyed to be starting this dream with Kiara Arrington. I’m excited to help my future students grow and see just how amazing each and every one of them is!</p>

              <p>My name is Gavin DeMoux, and I’ve been ballroom dancing competitively for 4 years. My introduction to dance began with musical theater at Miss. Margene’s Creative Dance Studio. I took classes in all sorts of styles, from jazz to hip-hop, before I first found interest in ballroom dance when I joined the performance ballroom team at Copper Hills High School. There, I had the honor to both choreograph and compete in ballroom competitions across the state for 3 years. During my senior year, along with dancing for the school, I danced with the BYU Youth Ballroom program. For BYU, we danced in competitions throughout the nation and placed 3rd at our final competition, the BYU Dancesport National Competition. I currently dance and study graphic design at UVU. I love to fish, hike, and dream of someday having a home of my own in the mountains. As a coach, I look to share my passion for the art that is ballroom with others. I am excited to help dancers grow in confidence and improve technique as we learn together!</p>
